Speech --> STL
Preserve Scale


Speech to Text:
    - Very simple GUI with a button for record
    - https://github.com/spatialaudio/python-sounddevice/blob/master/sounddevice.py
    - 
        - record()
        - 



Text to Information:
    - takes in text and makes a list of 2DShapes
    - extract information needed for each 3D part

    

Information Format:
    - Dictionary of properties
    - Each Sketch knows its measurements (radius, side length, etc.) and surface
    - Each 3dObject knows a sketch and an extrude level OR it knows a simple object type (sphere, box, etc.)
    - Object3D class
        - simple object type
        - measurements for that object
        - toString

    - Class System
        - Objects
            - Rectangular Prism has a subclass of Cube
                - Width
                - Height
                - Length
            - Sphere
                - Diameter
                - radius
            - Cylinder
                - Width 
                - Height
        - Modifiers
            -
